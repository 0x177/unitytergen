# unitytergen
An easy-to-use terrain generator for unity!


//name is a WIP

# usage
1- Create a new game object. Name it "generator"

2- add a mesh renderer and a mesh filter

2- Drag the MeshGenerator script to the generator object you just made

2- From the inspector tab, choose a mesh for the grass

3- If wanted, change the xsize and ysize values(things break after 250 so its alredy on max size)

4- Boom! tou now have a randomly generated terrain with grass!
